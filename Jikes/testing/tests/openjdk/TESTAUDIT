Name:		RoundingTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
An expected overflow does not occur and an exception is never correctly thrown

Name:		CompareToTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
CompareTo method from BigDecimal throws Arithmetic Exception about a negative exponent, no such issue with Hotspot. Some tests do not return the expected value even in hotspot, though no error is thrown

Name:		Constructor
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
The correct exception is not thrown when an incorrect constructor value is applied, instead a Sting index out of bound exception is thrown inside Big Decimal

Name:		IntegralDivisionTests
Path:
An exception is thrown inside the classpath divideToIntegralValue method in BigDecimal, reports a negative scale where none is present (as far as I can tell)

Name:		PowTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
Extrema power tests fail, overflow tests cause outOfMemoryErrors which is potentiall erroneous

Name:		AddTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
Issues with big decimal implementaion throwing exceptions with extrema values

Name:		DivideTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
BigDecimals throws Arithmetic Exception: Rounding necassary. This could potentially just be a limitation rather than an error

Name:		ZeroScalingTests
Path:		java/math/BigDecimal
An array index out of bounds exception occurs inside the big integer implementation when asked to add

Name:		StrippingZerosTest

Name:		Supplementary
Path:		java/util/StringTokenizer
StringTokenizer incorrectly uses supplied delimiters to tokenize

Name:		ResetPos
Path:		java/util/StringTokenizer
StringTokenizer failes to correctly resent the position in the string, resulting in erreoneos strings, this is a result of incorrectly applying delimiters

Name:		BSMethods
Path:		java/util/BitSet
Uses time elapsed, hence the test will never actually work under this framework. Regardless, it's a good set of tests that Jikes clearly fails at the moment.

Name:		StickySize
Path:		java/util/BitSet
A complete failure, brief look at the test seems to indicate that it is a legitimate failure. Results are repeatable

Name:		RetainAll
Path:		java/util/EnumSet
There doesn't seem to be a Jumbo and Regular implementaion of EnumSet, jut a base EnumSet implementation. The consequences of this I am unsure of.

Name:		OneUniverse
Path:		java/util/EnumSet
This requires further investigation, results are repeatable. I think the ClassPath enumset implementation has a few issues....

Name:		BogusEnumSet
Path:		java/util/EnumSet
Jikes failes to find java.util.RegularEnumSet, which fits with the above result, seems to indicate there is only one EnumSet, not the Dual Regular/Jumbo

Name:		EnumSetBash
Path:		java/util/EnumSet
An exception is thrown when attempting to call EnumSet.allOf with an empty set, the doco for this indicates that this should not be the case, an error should only be thrown on a null pointer

Name:		AllOf
Path:		java/util/EnumSet
An exception is thrown when attempting to call EnumSet.allOf with an empty set, the doco for this indicates that this should not be the case, an error should only be thrown on a null pointer. Same issue as EnumSetBash

Name:		InsertWrongType
Path:		java/util/EnumSet	
An incorrect enum type is allowed to be added to an enum set without an expected exception being thrown

Name:		ToString
Path:		java/util/AbstractCollection
General issues with toString not working on collections, presumably arise when a collection is added to itself

Name:		ArrayObjectMethods
Path:		java/util/Arrays
Jikes fails different amounts each time, but the test seems ok. Also uses random input, however if all tests are passed the output is the same.

Name:		Fill
Path:		java/util/Arrays
An exception was thrown in the correct place, but it was the wrong exception.

Name:		CopyMethods
Path:		java/util/Arrays
Appears to be failing in Classpath implementation, Illegal argument exception way down the stack in Arrays.fill

Name:		IteratorAtEnd
Path:		java/util/Collection
next() does not change iterator state if it throws NoSuchElementException, results in index out of bound exceptions

Name:		BiggernYours
Path:		java/util/Collection	
Test has concurrent elements, although a full pass results in the same output Jikes seems to fail random amounts of tests.

Name:		DistinctSeeds
Path:		java/util/Random
New Random objects are not supplied with different seeds

Path:		java/util/TreeMap
An expected ClassCastException is never thrown, though the javadoc related to it implies it technically doesnt have to (needs confirmation)

Can't quite follow exactly whats happening here, from a distance it looks ok. 

Name:		MinMax
Path:		java/util/Collections
Throws a very wrong NoSuchElementException

Collections.reverseOrder(comparator) fails miserably

Name:		CheckedSetBash
Path:		java/util/Collections
an addAll completely fails to do anything

Name:		ReverseOrder
Path:		java/util/Collections
Collections sort reverse comparator doesnt work, just goes by the normal comparator

Name:		BigBinarySearch
Path:		java/util/Collections
General failures with large searches in AbstractList, I don't fully understand the ins and outs of whats happening but the test seems ok

Name:		CheckedNull
Path:		java/util/Collections
Ton's of exceptions thrown where none exist under hotspot

Name:		Frequency

Empty utility collections do not present as singleton sets as they should

Name:		AsLifoQueue
Path:		java/util/Collections
Jikes does not thrown an exception when a string is attempted to be added to an abstract LinkedBlockingQueue of type null


Name:		ReadObject
Path:		java/util/Hashtable
Something to do with wrapping inputs to a hastable? There is no non determinism here so I've marked it as good, but it will need a further review.

Name:		Bug4512215
Path:		java/util/Currency
Classpath doesnt support currency code XBD, should be fixed with openJDK, not really a bug, just a limitation

Name:		SimpleEntries
Path:		java/util/AbstractMap
SimpleImmutableEntry returns SimpleEntry when instanceof is used upon it

Name:		ToString
Path:		java/util/AbstractMap
toString method in Abstract Map fails if size changes in between a call to size and an attempt to iterate

Name:		Equals
Path:		java/util/AbstractMap

Name:		Bug6533203
Path:		java/util/ArrayList
Can't quite follow, looks like an exception isn't being thrown when it should, or perhaps the wrong one.

Name:		ForgetMeNot
Path:		java/util/PriorityQueue
Index out of bounds exceptions inside priority queue implementation

Name:		PriorityQueueSort
Path:		java/util/PriorityQueue
Something is very wrong with the removal operation on Priority Queues

Name:		EnumMapBash
Path:		java/util/EnumMap
General EnumMap failings, test looks fine in terms of compliance with framework

Name:		UUIDTest
Path:		java/util/UUID
UUID behaves incorrectly....in exactly what manner I'm not sure of, as it's a library item it should benefit from switching to OpenJDK. There are calls to random within the test however I'm pretty sure it's still deterministic from a pass/fail standpoint

Name:		StockName
Path:		java/util/Formattable
Jikes doesn't like formatting in french.....

Name:		NaNInfinityParsing

Name:		Encodings
Path:		java/lang/String
Jikes throws a NoSuchMethod error when trying to call a method within the class, this is really odd and needs further investigation

Name:		ToUpperCase

Name:		ForInnerClass
Path:		java/lang/Class/getModifiers
Jikes fails to realise an inner class is protected

Name:		StripACC_SUPER
Path:		java/lang/Class/getModifiers

Null Queue arguments crash reference handling thread (I may have copied that straight from the test itself, but it seems to fit with what's happening.)

Name:		Supplementary
Path:		java/lang/StringBuffer
Again, issues with reading a complicated string correctly

Name:		AppendCharSequence
Path:		java/lang/StringBuffer
Jikes does not allow the appention of a null string, this does not match the spec

Name:		Exceptions
Path:		java/lang/StringBuffer
Jikes throws the wanted exception, but it's not exactly worded as expected, it's not really a failure, gonna leave it in because it's a nice test and should pass with openJDK

Name:		NaNInfinityParsing
Path:		java/lang/Double
Jikes incorrectly passes illegal string NaNf as NaN - same as earlier

Name:		Decode
Path:		java/lang/Long
Another incorrectly allowed leading plus

Name:		BitTwiddle
Path:		java/lang/Long
Signum breaks when using MIN_VALUE

Name:		StackTraceSerialization

Path:		java/lang/Integer
Again with the leading pluses

Name:		BitTwiddle
Path:		java/lang/Integer
Signum is again, broken.

Name:		Supplementary

Jikes allows arrays above 256 dimensions, this is not to spec

Name:		StringsAndBounds

Something to do with boxing...?? The test itself seems to fit the framework, overall result is repeatable.
